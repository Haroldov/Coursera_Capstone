## 1. Introduction
<p align="justify">The Recommender Systems (RS) are widely used in applications such as Netflix, Facebook, Instagram, among others. A RS is a system able to recognize patterns in order to make valuable suggestions of related material. Customers often do not know what specifically want, this along with a RS converge in a bidirectional satisfaction service-customer.  </p>

<p align="justify">Foursquare is a website where people comment and rank food sites, coffee sites, malls and parks. For instance, let's think that a Foursquare's user had to move to New York and he/she does not know anything about the places that surround him/her. Foursquare location data along with a recommender system can suggest a place in order to help this user to get acquainted with the new environment. The place that will be suggested, will not be a random suggestion, but instead will be a place for him/her pleasure. Thus, previous data from this user and the other ones who have been in the same situation will be used to predict a good public site for him.</p>
