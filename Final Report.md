## 1. Introduction
<p align="justify">Recently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are widely used in the study of data instead of traditional statistics. ML algorithms bring advantages because offer solutions to problems related to the big quantities of data and set a fewer constraints than traditional statistics. In particular, unsupervised learning algorithms are used to find patterns in data in terms of similarity between samples. Depending on the pattern within the data, different algorithms are used. For non-convex data it is used Density-Based Spatial Clustering (DBScan). On the other hand, for convex data it is used a well known algorithm as K-Means. </p>

<p align="justify">Foursquare is a website where people comment and rank food sites, coffee sites, malls and parks. For instance, let's think that a Foursquare's user had to move to New York and he/she does not know anything about the places that surround him/her. Foursquare location data along with a recommender system can suggest a place in order to help this user to get acquainted with the new environment. The place that will be suggested, will not be a random suggestion, but instead will be a place for him/her pleasure. Thus, previous data from this user and the other ones who have been in the same situation will be used to predict a good public site for him.</p>
