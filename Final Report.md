## 1. Introduction
<p align="justify">Recently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are widely used in the study of data instead of traditional statistics. ML algorithms bring advantages because they offer solutions to problems related to the big quantities of data and set fewer constraints than traditional statistics. In particular, unsupervised learning algorithms are used to find patterns in data in terms of similarity between samples. Depending on the pattern within the data, different algorithms are used. For non-convex data it is used Density-Based Spatial Clustering (DBScan). On the other hand, for convex data it is used a well known algorithm as K-Means. </p>

<p align="justify">Foursquare is a website where people comment and rank food sites, coffee sites, malls and parks. For instance, let's think that a Foursquare user had to move from New York city, USA to the city of Toronto, Canada. Foursquare location data along with a clustering algorithm can suggest a neighborhood in order to help this user to live in Toronto in a similar place. The neighborhood that will be suggested, will not be a random suggestion, but instead will be a place for his pleasure. Thus, previous data from New York and Toronto will be used to predict a good living neighborhood for him.</p>

## 2. Data

<p align="justify">For this project the Foursquare API will be used. A list of neighborhoods in New York and Toronto is downloaded and their respective location in longitude and latitude coordinates is obtained. The sources are the following: </p>

* New York neighborhoods: https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/fbpwbovar7lf8p5sgddm06cgipa2rxpe.json
* Toronto neighborhoods: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M

<p align="justify">The data downloaded are the neighborhoods located in New York and Toronto. Moreover, their specific coordinates are merged. Only Manhattan neighborhoods and boroughs that contain the string "Toronto" are taken into account. A Foursquare API GET request is sent in order to adquire the surrounds venues that are within a radius of 500m. The data is formated using one hot encoding with the categories of each venue. Then, the venues are grouped by neighborhoods computing the mean of each feature.</p>

<p align="justify">The similarities will be determined based on the frequency of the categories found in the neighborhoods. These similarities found are a strong indicator for a user and can help him to decide whether to move in a particular neighborhood near the center of Toronto or not. </p>

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1. Feature Extraction
<p align="justify">For feature extraction One Hot Encoding is used in terms of categories. Therefore, each feature is a category that belongs to a venue. Each feature becomes binary, this means that 1 means this category is found in the venue and 0 means the opposite. Then, all the venues are grouped by the neighborhoods, computing at the same time the mean. This will give us a venue for each row and each column will contain the frequency of occurrence of that particular category.</p>

### 3.2. Unsupervised Learning
<p align="justify">For the purpose of doing unsupervised learning to found similarities between neighborhoods, a clustering algorithm is implemented. In this case K-Means is used due to its simplicity and its similiraty approach to found patterns. </p>

* **K-Means:**

<p align="justify">K-Means is a clustering algorithm. This algorithm search clusters within the data and the main objective function is to minimize the data dispersion for each cluster. Thus, each group found represents a set of data with a pattern inside the muldimensional features. </p>

In the following figure there is a graphical example of how a K-Means algorithm works. As it is possible to see, dispersion is minimized by representing all clustered data into one group or cluster.

</p>

<p align="justify">It is necessary for this algorithm to have a prior idea about the number of clusters since it is considered an input of this algorithm. For this reason, the elbow method is implemented. A chart that compares error vs number of cluster is done and the elbow is selected. Then, further analysis of each cluster is done. </p>

## 4. Results

<p align="justify">Firstly, data is plotted in a geographical map to get a notion of the world location. In the two following images are shown the neighborhoods in Manhattan and Toronto. </p>

</p>

<p align="justify">Secondly, the cluster algorithm is implemented. For this purpose, it is necessary to have a prior idea about the number of clusters. Therefore, the mean squared error (MSE) is plotted vs the number of clusters. The number of clusters start with a value of 1 increasing until a value of 10. This chart is shown in the image below. </p>

</p>

<p align="justify">As it is expected, the MSE decreases over the number of clusters. The elbow method here is implemented in order to select the appropriate number of groups. In this case, it is possible to see that the elbow is found more or less arround 5. The MSE found below this number shows little changes rather than big ones. Finally, once the number of clusters is fixed, the clustering algorithm is repeated through samples and each neighborhood is labeled according to the clusters found.</p>


<p align="justify">For visualization purposes, the geographical data is again plotted but with different colors. Each color represents the cluster for which that neighborhood belongs. This image is shown below.</p>

</p>

<p align="justify">In this image it is evident that cluster algorithm is not segmenting the neighborhoods for location areas. This means that it is not true that geolocation of neighborhoods is correlated with the categories of the venues arround each neighborhood. Yet, it is possible to see which neighborhoods within Manhattan, New York are more similar to the neighborhoods within Toronto. Those neighborhoods that are similiar among them belong to the same cluster. Hence, they have the same color in the image above.</p>

<p align="justify">In the image below it is found the proportion of the neighborhoods assigned to each cluster. For this reason a waffle chart is implemented. There are two major clusters and two minor clusters. Moreover, there is a cluster that has only one neighborhood. This neighborhood is Lawrence Park from Toronto. This neighborhood has no similarity with New York city.</p>

<p align="justify">For practical purposes, a word cloud is shown in the image below. In this way, a person trying to locate a similar neighborhood in Toronto can locate it looking for the neighborhoods with the same color. Here we can se that .</p>
